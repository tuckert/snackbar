###Restaurant orders, payments, and curbside pickups
This is basically just a typicall ecommerce page.  Stripe is used for payment processing.  Once and order has been placed, it's details are preserved and cannot be changed by changing the prices on items.  An Order gets prices for each item the moment the order is processed.  Therefore changing item prices during an order also updates the order upon submission.  This was a learning project that I stopped working on for something else.
